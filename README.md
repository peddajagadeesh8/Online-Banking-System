# ONLINE BANKING SYSTEM

## Overview

This project implements a MySQL database designed to efficiently manage and organize project-related data. It includes six related tables to store various aspects of the project, enabling streamlined data retrieval and manipulation. The project also involves data cleaning and analysis using Python, along with visualizations created with Matplotlib to illustrate key findings.

## Purpose

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Organization**: Establishing a clear framework for storing project information.
2. **Data Integrity**: Maintaining relationships between different data entities to promote consistency and accuracy.
3. **Data Analysis**: Performing data cleaning and extracting insights using Python.
4. **Visualization**: Developing charts and graphs using Matplotlib to illustrate key findings.
5. **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Supporting informed decision-making through systematic data management and analysis.

## Database Design

An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram has been created to represent the database architecture and relationships among the six tables. This diagram serves as a blueprint for the database structure.

## Data Analysis

Data cleaning and analysis were performed using Python to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. This process involved:

- Identifying and handling missing values
- Normalizing data formats
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Visualizations

Visualizations were created using Matplotlib to illustrate key findings from the data analysis. These visualizations include:

- Bar charts
- Line graphs
- Pie charts

You can find the visualizations in the `visualizations` folder.

## Technologies Used

- MySQL
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and visualization)
